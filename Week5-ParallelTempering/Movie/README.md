# Movie Folder

This folder contains movies generated from the MD trajectories.

- **300K_15ns.mp4**: A movie showing the trajectory of alanine dipeptide at 300 K over 15 ns of simulation time.
- **movie_temp300_exchange.mp4**: A movie showing the trajectory of alanine dipeptide with temperature exchanges during the parallel tempering MD simulation.

These movies provide visual insights into the molecular dynamics of alanine dipeptide, including structural changes and behavior at different temperatures. They were generated using ChimeraX and GROMACS visualization tools.
