# Week 5 - Parallel Tempering MD Project

This directory contains the files and folders related to the Week 5 parallel tempering molecular dynamics (MD) project. The project aims to investigate the behavior of alanine dipeptide at different temperatures using replica exchange (parallel tempering) MD simulations.

## Folders:
- **Assignment.md**: Contains the project description and the assignment instructions.
- **Analysis/**: Contains the analysis of the MD simulation results in a Jupyter notebook.
- **Inputs/**: Contains all the input files required to run the MD simulations.
- **Figure/**: Contains figures generated during the analysis.
- **Movie/**: Contains movie files generated from the MD trajectories.

Each subdirectory has its own README file describing its contents in detail.
