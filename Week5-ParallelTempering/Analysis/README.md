# Analysis Folder

This folder contains the analysis for the parallel tempering MD project.

- **analysis.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis of the MD simulation results. The notebook includes calculations such as potential energy histograms, free energy surface (FES) plots, and temperature replica exchanges over time.
  
The analysis explores the temperature-dependent behavior of alanine dipeptide, including free energy surface comparisons between different temperatures, and the effectiveness of replica exchange. 

Make sure to have `mdtraj`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` installed before running the notebook.
