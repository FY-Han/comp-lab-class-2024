# 1v1d_gmx_opc

## Overview

This folder contains the setup files and configurations for performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the 1v1d protein system using the OPC water model. The initial setup files were generated using CHARMM-GUI, and the MD simulations were performed using GROMACS. The setup process involves several stages, such as solvation, ion placement, periodic boundary conditions (PBC) setup, and equilibration. 

The actual GROMACS simulation was performed in the `gromacs/` subdirectory, which contains input files, outputs, and various data produced during the simulation runs.

## Directory Contents

### CHARMM-GUI Setup Files

These files were generated by CHARMM-GUI to prepare the system for GROMACS simulations. They include configurations for solvation, ion placement, and periodic boundary conditions:

- `1v1d.cif`: The initial CIF file of the 1v1d protein.
- `glycan.yml`: Configuration file related to glycosylation, if applicable.
- `step1_pdbreader.*`: Files generated for the initial PDB reading and setup of the protein structure.
- `step2.*`: Files generated for solvation (`waterbox`), ion placement, and subsequent structural configurations.
- `step3_pbcsetup.*`: Files involved in setting up periodic boundary conditions for the simulation.
- `toppar/`: Contains topology parameter files required by CHARMM.

### Analysis and Configuration Files

- `checkfft.py`: Python script for checking Fourier transform configurations.
- `input.config.dat`: Configuration file related to the simulation setup.
- `addCrystPdb.py`: Python script for adding crystallographic information to PDB files.
- `toppar.str`: Topology-related setup scripts.

### GROMACS Simulation (`gromacs/`)

This directory contains all the GROMACS-related files used during the MD simulation, including input files, output logs, trajectory files, and energy data. The simulation steps include minimization, equilibration, and production runs.

#### Key Files

- **Input Files**:
  - `step3_input.gro`, `step3_input.pdb`, `step3_input.psf`: Input files used for the simulation, generated from CHARMM-GUI.
  - `step4.0_minimization.mdp`, `step4.1_equilibration.mdp`, `step5_production.mdp`: GROMACS parameter files for the different stages of the simulation.

- **Output Files**:
  - `step4.0_minimization.*`, `step4.1_equilibration.*`, `step5_*.cpt`, `step5_*.xtc`, `step5_*.edr`, `step5_*.log`: These files represent the outputs from minimization, equilibration, and production runs. They include coordinate files (`.gro`), checkpoint files (`.cpt`), energy data (`.edr`), and trajectory files (`.xtc`).
  - `concatenated.xtc`, `wrapped.xtc`: Trajectory files that were concatenated and unwrapped to account for periodic boundary conditions.

- **Additional Files**:
  - `index.ndx`: Index file used for defining groups within the simulation.
  - `topol.top`: Topology file for the system.
  - Various `.xvg` files: These are analysis outputs from GROMACS, including properties like radius of gyration (`rgyration.xvg`), persistence length (`persist.xvg`), and more.

### Purpose of Each Step

1. **Minimization (`step4.0_minimization`)**:
   - This step ensures that the system's potential energy is minimized, removing any bad contacts or steric clashes before proceeding with the simulation.
   
2. **Equilibration (`step4.1_equilibration`)**:
   - In this phase, the system is equilibrated to stabilize the temperature and pressure. The protein and solvent are allowed to relax before beginning the production phase.
   
3. **Production (`step5_production`)**:
   - The main molecular dynamics simulation is performed during this stage. Trajectories and relevant data (energy, positions, velocities, etc.) are recorded for analysis.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Setup**: The initial setup of the 1v1d protein system was performed using CHARMM-GUI, which generated the necessary input files. These files were transferred to the GROMACS environment for MD simulations.
  
2. **Simulation**: The MD simulations were carried out in GROMACS in three stages: energy minimization, equilibration, and production.

3. **Analysis**: The resulting trajectories and energy data from the production simulation were analyzed, and various structural properties of the system were computed.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: The `1v1d_gmx_opc/` directory contains the necessary CHARMM-GUI output files used for simulation setup in GROMACS. Ensure that GROMACS is installed and properly configured on your system.

2. **Running the Simulations**: The simulations were run using SLURM job submission scripts located in the `gromacs/` directory. Use `run_setup.sbatch` for submitting the job to the SLURM workload manager.

3. **Post-Processing**: After the simulations are complete, use the provided trajectory files (`concatenated.xtc`, `wrapped.xtc`) for analysis in tools like VMD or PyMOL.

## Notes

- The molecular dynamics simulations require GROMACS and associated libraries (e.g., MPI) for parallel processing.
- Ensure that your system has sufficient computational resources to handle the trajectory and energy data files.
- For detailed analysis of the simulation results, refer to the `.xvg` files in the `gromacs/` directory.
