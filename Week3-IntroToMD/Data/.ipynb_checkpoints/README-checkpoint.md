# Molecular Dynamics Simulation Data - GROMACS

This directory contains data and output files from a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation conducted using GROMACS. The files represent various stages of the simulation, including energy data, trajectory information, and results from specific analysis tasks such as RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) and Radius of Gyration calculations.

## Files Overview

### Simulation Files

- **md_0_1.tpr**: The run input file for the MD simulation, generated by `grompp`. This file contains all the parameters of the simulation, including the molecular topology, simulation box, and MD settings.
- **md_0_1.xtc**: Compressed trajectory file storing the coordinates of atoms at various time steps during the simulation. It’s used for analyzing the system’s behavior over time.
- **md_0_1_noPBC.xtc**: A processed trajectory file with no periodic boundary conditions (PBC) applied. This file is typically generated after processing the original trajectory to remove PBC artifacts.
- **md_0_1.gro**: The structure file used as the input for the simulation. It includes atomic coordinates and box dimensions.
- **md_0_1.cpt**: A checkpoint file that contains all the necessary data to restart the simulation from this point. It includes velocities, coordinates, and simulation parameters.
- **md_0_1_prev.cpt**: The previous checkpoint file, saved before the most recent checkpoint.
- **md_0_1.edr**: The energy file, which contains the energy data from the simulation, such as potential energy, kinetic energy, temperature, etc.
- **md_0_1.log**: The log file containing detailed output of the MD simulation, including steps taken, energies, and any potential warnings or errors during the run.

### Analysis Files

- **rmsd.xvg**: RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) data for the system as calculated from the MD trajectory. RMSD is typically used to measure how much the structure deviates from the reference structure over time.
- **rmsd_xtal.xvg**: RMSD data comparing the MD structure to a crystal structure, allowing for a comparison between simulated dynamics and experimental data.
- **gyrate.xvg**: Radius of Gyration (Rg) data over time. The radius of gyration is a measure of the compactness of the molecular system during the simulation.

### Output and Miscellaneous Files

- **complabjob_fengyang.out**: Output file generated from a submitted SLURM job, containing details about the job execution, including any errors or results printed to the console during the job.
- **submit.slurm**: SLURM batch script used to submit the MD simulation job to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. This script specifies resources (e.g., number of cores, time) and the commands to run the GROMACS simulation.
- **README.md**: This file, containing descriptions of the folder’s contents and explanations of the different files.

## How to Use These Files

1. **Analyzing the Trajectory**:
   - Use the `md_0_1.xtc` or `md_0_1_noPBC.xtc` file in conjunction with the `md_0_1.tpr` file to analyze the MD simulation using tools such as `gmx rms`, `gmx gyrate`, and other GROMACS utilities.
   - Example: Calculate RMSD from the trajectory using GROMACS:
     ```bash
     gmx rms -s md_0_1.tpr -f md_0_1.xtc -o rmsd.xvg
     ```

2. **Restarting the Simulation**:
   - If the simulation needs to be restarted from the last checkpoint, you can use the `md_0_1.cpt` or `md_0_1_prev.cpt` file.
     ```bash
     gmx mdrun -s md_0_1.tpr -cpi md_0_1.cpt
     ```

3. **Examining Energy Data**:
   - The energy file `md_0_1.edr` can be processed with `gmx energy` to extract specific energy terms:
     ```bash
     gmx energy -f md_0_1.edr -o energy.xvg
     ```

4. **SLURM Job Management**:
   - The `submit.slurm` script was used to submit the job to an HPC cluster. If adjustments to resource allocation or commands are needed, this file can be modified and resubmitted:
     ```bash
     sbatch submit.slurm
     ```
