# GROMACS Molecular Dynamics Setup

This directory contains all the necessary files for setting up and running a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the protein structure **2JOF** using GROMACS. The files are organized based on the different stages of the simulation workflow, including system preparation, energy minimization, and equilibration (NVT and NPT). Additionally, output files such as logs, energy files, and trajectory data are provided for analysis.

## Files Overview

### Input Files

- **2JOF_clean.pdb**: The cleaned-up PDB structure file of the protein used as the starting point for the MD simulation.
- **2JOF_processed.gro**: GROMACS-formatted structure file created after processing the original PDB file with `gmx pdb2gmx`.
- **2JOF_newbox.gro**: GROMACS structure file after defining the simulation box with `gmx editconf`.
- **2JOF_solv.gro**: The solvated structure file after adding water molecules to the system using `gmx solvate`.
- **2JOF_solv_ions.gro**: The structure file after adding ions to neutralize the system using `gmx genion`.
- **topol.top**: The topology file generated by `gmx pdb2gmx` that contains information about the system's molecules and interactions.

### Position Restraint

- **posre.itp**: File that defines the position restraints for the protein atoms, used during equilibration to prevent large movements of the protein backbone.

### Simulation Parameter and Run Files

- **ions.tpr**: The binary input file for adding ions to the system, generated by `gmx grompp`.
- **2JOF_energy_minimization.tpr**: The binary input file used for the energy minimization stage, generated by `gmx grompp`.
- **nvt.tpr**: The input file for the constant volume and temperature equilibration (NVT) stage.
- **npt.tpr**: The input file for the constant pressure and temperature equilibration (NPT) stage.

### Energy Minimization Files

- **2JOF_energy_minimization.edr**: Energy file containing energy information from the energy minimization step.
- **2JOF_energy_minimization.trr**: Full-precision trajectory file for energy minimization.
